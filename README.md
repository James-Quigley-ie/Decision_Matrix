## AHP Decision Matrix Calculator
This project is a Python implementation of the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) to calculate a decision matrix for assessing the suitability of a wind farm in North Holland. The goal is to provide a systematic and quantitative approach to evaluate different criteria and alternatives involved in the decision-making process.

## Requirements
  - Python 3.x
  - Pandas
  - Numpy

## Acknowledgments
This project was inspired by the need for a structured approach to assess the suitability of a wind farm in North Holland. The AHP methodology provides a transparent and systematic way to incorporate various factors into the decision-making process.
